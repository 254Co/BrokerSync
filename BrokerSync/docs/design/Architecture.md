### Matching Algorithm Module
   
  Responsibilities:
    - Order Matching: Matches buy and sell orders within the same product, contract, delivery date, and vintage, using various matching algorithms tailored to the specific needs of each product type.
    - Algorithm Flexibility: Supports different matching algorithms (e.g., price-time priority, pro-rata) depending on the characteristics of the product and contract.
    - Real-Time Processing: Consumes order book updates in real-time from the Order Book Updates Topic, processes matches, and publishes matched trades to the Matched Trades Topic.
  
  Subcomponents:
    - Matching Engine: The core component that implements the matching logic, ensuring that orders are matched efficiently and fairly based on the selected algorithm.
    - Partial Fill Manager: Manages orders that are partially filled, ensuring that remaining quantities are correctly updated and re-queued for further matching.
  
  Integration with Iceberg:
    - Matched Trades Table: An Iceberg table that stores all matched trades, categorized by product, contract, delivery date, and vintage, enabling detailed historical analysis and reporting.

 ### Price Discovery Module
   
  Responsibilities:
    - Price Calculation: Calculates the assesed/indicative price for each contract based on the current state of the order book and historical trades the contract and related or correlated contracts.
