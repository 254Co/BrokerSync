Integration Layer: Third-party services and APIs for market data, compliance, and communication.
Components Overview
Frontend:
Built with a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js).
Responsive design for use on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Backend:
RESTful API services developed using a robust backend framework (e.g., Spring Boot, Django, or Express).
Microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.
Database:

Authentication
BrokerSync's API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. To access any secured endpoints, a valid JWT token must be included in the Authorization header of the request.

Authorization Header Example:
makefile
Copy code
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
Error Handling
BrokerSync’s API follows standard HTTP status codes for error handling:

200 OK: Request was successful.
400 Bad Request: The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.
401 Unauthorized: Authentication failed or user does not have permissions for the requested operation.
404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found.
500 Internal Server Error: An error occurred on the server.
Each error response will include a JSON object with the following fields:

status: HTTP status code
message: A human-readable message explaining the error
details: (Optional) Additional information about the error
Rate Limiting
To ensure fair usage and protect the platform from abuse, BrokerSync's API may implement rate limiting. Clients will be notified via HTTP headers when rate limits are approaching or exceeded:

X-RateLimit-Limit: The maximum number of requests allowed within a certain timeframe.
X-RateLimit-Remaining: The number of requests remaining in the current timeframe.
X-RateLimit-Reset: The time at which the rate limit will reset.
