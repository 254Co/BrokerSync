### API Documentation

#### REST API Overview

BrokerSyncâ€™s REST API provides secure and scalable access to the platformâ€™s core features. The API is designed for integration with third-party systems, allowing users to automate order management, retrieve market data, manage client portfolios, and more.

#### API Endpoints

The API endpoints cover a range of functionalities such as authentication, order management, client management, market data retrieval, report generation, and compliance checks. Each endpoint follows REST principles and uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

#### Authentication

BrokerSync's API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. To access any secured endpoints, a valid JWT token must be included in the Authorization header of the request.

#### Error Handling

BrokerSyncâ€™s API follows standard HTTP status codes for error handling. Each error response will include a JSON object with an HTTP status code, a human-readable message explaining the error, and optional additional information.

#### Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and protect the platform from abuse, BrokerSync's API may implement rate limiting. Clients will be notified via HTTP headers when rate limits are approaching or exceeded.

---

### Database Schema

#### ER Diagram

The Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram provides a visual representation of the database structure, showing the relationships between different entities such as `Clients`, `Orders`, `MarketData`, `Reports`, and `ComplianceLogs`.

#### Table Structures

The core tables in the BrokerSync database include `Clients`, `Orders`, `MarketData`, `Reports`, and `ComplianceLogs`. Each table is designed with appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and data types to support the platform's functionality.

#### Relationships

- **Clients to Orders**: One-to-Many (A client can have multiple orders)
- **Clients to Reports**: One-to-Many (A client can have multiple reports)
- **Clients to ComplianceLogs**: One-to-Many (A client can have multiple compliance logs)

#### Indexing and Optimization

Indexing strategies include primary keys, foreign keys, and full-text search indexes to ensure efficient querying. Partitioning may be applied to large tables like `Orders` and `MarketData` for improved performance.
