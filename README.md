2. System Architecture

High-Level Architecture
BrokerSync is a multi-tiered platform consisting of the following layers:

Presentation Layer: The frontend interface used by brokers and clients.
Application Layer: The backend logic that processes orders, manages CRM functions, and handles data analytics.
Data Layer: The database systems storing order data, client information, and historical market data.
Integration Layer: Third-party services and APIs for market data, compliance, and communication.
Components Overview
Frontend:
Built with a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js).
Responsive design for use on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Backend:
RESTful API services developed using a robust backend framework (e.g., Spring Boot, Django, or Express).
Microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.
Database:
Relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL) for structured data.
NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB or Cassandra) for unstructured data.
In-memory data store (e.g., Redis) for caching and quick access.
Third-Party Integrations:
Market data providers (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters).
Compliance and KYC services.
Email and messaging platforms (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid).
DevOps:
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
Containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes.
Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
Data Flow
Order Placement: User submits an order via the frontend, which is processed by the backend and stored in the database. The order is then routed to the appropriate exchange or trading venue.
Client Management: Client data is captured during onboarding and managed through the CRM system, with data stored in a relational database.
Analytics: Real-time and historical data is processed and analyzed, with insights provided to users via dashboards and reports.
3. Technology Stack

Frontend
Framework: React (JavaScript) for building interactive user interfaces.
Styling: CSS3 with a preprocessor like SASS or LESS, and a component library like Material-UI or Bootstrap.
State Management: Redux or Context API for managing application state.
Testing: Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing.
Backend
Framework: Spring Boot (Java) for building robust REST APIs.
Microservices: Decomposed architecture using Docker containers.
Authentication: OAuth2 or JWT for secure API access.
Testing: JUnit for unit tests, and Postman for API testing.
Database
Relational Database: PostgreSQL for structured data such as orders, clients, and financial transactions.
NoSQL Database: MongoDB for handling unstructured data such as logs and audit trails.
Caching: Redis for session management and caching frequently accessed data.
Third-Party Integrations
Market Data: Integration with financial data providers for real-time market updates.
KYC/Compliance: Integration with services like Onfido or ComplyAdvantage for client verification.
Messaging: Integration with Twilio for SMS notifications and SendGrid for email communication.
DevOps
CI/CD: Jenkins or GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment.
Containerization: Docker for containerizing services, with Kubernetes for orchestration.
Monitoring: Prometheus for monitoring system metrics, with Grafana for visualization.
